Hi, I'm Rubem Fridolino Christ Neto, a **vide game developer, artist and programmer** from Brazil. I'm in my way to study in Portugal Game Development and learn everything that I can.
I have some games published on **[itch.io](https://rubemchrist.itch.io/)** and my favorite engine is **[Unity](https://unity.com/)**, but I am learning to use **[Godot](https://godotengine.org/)** in my spare time.
By the end of this year(2020) I plan to launch 3 courses on udemy about game development and game art in 2D and 3D with **Blender, Photoshop and Unity**.
